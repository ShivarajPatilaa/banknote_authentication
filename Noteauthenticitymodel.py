# ### Bank Note Authentication

# __Data was obtained from images captured from both genuine and counterfeit banknote-like specimens. To digitize these specimens, we employed an industrial camera typically employed for print inspection. The resulting images are 400x400 pixels in size. These high-quality grayscale images, acquired at a resolution of approximately 660 dots per inch (dpi), were then subjected to feature extraction using the Wavelet Transform technique.__
